## Accelerating Fluspect with an analytical algorithm

* Users are assumed to be familiar with the Fluspect model. https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/Fluspect

* An analytical algorithm based on the K-M theory is proposed to replace the numerical algorithm for simulating mesophyll fluorescence matrices.



### Fortran 

* The original Fluspect is written in MATLAB. I translated it to Fortran first, and all experiments in the paper were tested using the Fortran version.


### MATLAB

* The MATLAB version will be released soon.

### Python

* The Python version will be released soon.
